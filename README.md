My Projects Include the following

[Housing Prices in Mexico](https://github.com/BarnabasObuya/portfolio/blob/main/1_Housing_in_Brazil_.ipynb)

In this project, I analyzed housing data from Mexico to determine whether property prices are more influenced by physical size or location. I began with comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationship of key variables, including square footage, number of rooms, and neighborhood zones. Using feature engineering and visualization techniques, I identified trends and outliers, then built multiple linear regression models to quantify the impact of each variable on price. I also evaluated model performance using metrics such as R², RMSE, and MAE to compare predictive strength.

The analysis revealed that location was a significantly stronger predictor of housing prices than property size. Neighborhood and regional factors consistently showed higher correlation with price and contributed more to the model's explanatory power. While larger properties generally commanded higher prices, the effect of square footage diminished when controlling for location. These findings suggest that, in Mexico’s real estate market, proximity to key urban centers or desirable neighborhoods plays a more critical role in pricing than the size of the property itself—a valuable insight for investors, developers, and policymakers.

2. Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires, Argentina
Built a linear regression model to predict apartment prices based on available features.

3. Air Quality in Nairobi, Kenya
Developed an ARMA time-series model to forecast PM2.5 particulate matter levels, analyzing trends in air pollution.

4. Earthquake Damage in Nepal
Applied logistic regression and decision tree models to predict the extent of structural damage caused by earthquakes.

5. Bankruptcy Prediction in Poland
Used random forest and gradient boosting classifiers to predict whether companies were likely to go bankrupt.

6. Customer Segmentation in the US
Built a K-means clustering model to group consumers, used PCA for dimensionality reduction, and created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash for visualization.

7. A/B Testing at WQU
Conducted a chi-square test to evaluate whether email campaigns impacted program enrollment. This project also involved building custom Python classes for an ETL process and designing a three-tiered interactive data application.

8. Volatility Forecasting in India
Built a GARCH model to predict asset volatility. I retrieved financial data via an API, stored it in an SQLite database, and even developed a custom API to serve real-time model predictions.
