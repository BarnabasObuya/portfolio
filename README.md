My Projects Include the following

1. Housing Prices in Mexico
Explored whether real estate prices are more influenced by property size or location using exploratory data analysis and regression techniques.

2. Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires, Argentina
Built a linear regression model to predict apartment prices based on available features.

3. Air Quality in Nairobi, Kenya
Developed an ARMA time-series model to forecast PM2.5 particulate matter levels, analyzing trends in air pollution.

4. Earthquake Damage in Nepal
Applied logistic regression and decision tree models to predict the extent of structural damage caused by earthquakes.

5. Bankruptcy Prediction in Poland
Used random forest and gradient boosting classifiers to predict whether companies were likely to go bankrupt.

6. Customer Segmentation in the US
Built a K-means clustering model to group consumers, used PCA for dimensionality reduction, and created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash for visualization.

7. A/B Testing at WQU
Conducted a chi-square test to evaluate whether email campaigns impacted program enrollment. This project also involved building custom Python classes for an ETL process and designing a three-tiered interactive data application.

8. Volatility Forecasting in India
Built a GARCH model to predict asset volatility. I retrieved financial data via an API, stored it in an SQLite database, and even developed a custom API to serve real-time model predictions.
